# Decision Log

## 2025-04-23: Python Module Structure

- **Context**: Need to standardize Python module structure for consistency across the monorepo
- **Options Considered**:
  1. Flat structure with all modules at top level
  2. Nested structure with language-specific subdirectories
  3. Package-based structure with virtual environments per module
- **Decision**: Option 2 - Nested structure with language-specific subdirectories
- **Rationale**: 
  - Provides clear organization by language
  - Works well with Bazel's target-based approach
  - Separates concerns while maintaining monorepo benefits
- **Implications**: 
  - Requires consistent BUILD.bazel files per module
  - Import paths need to follow repository structure
  - May require additional configuration for IDE integration
- **Related PRDs**: PRD-F1, PRD-F5

## 2025-04-23: Linting Configuration

- **Context**: Need to standardize code quality checks across multiple languages
- **Options Considered**:
  1. Language-specific tools managed separately
  2. Pre-commit hooks for consistent enforcement
  3. CI-only verification with blocking checks
- **Decision**: Option 2 - Pre-commit hooks with CI verification
- **Rationale**:
  - Prevents bad code from being committed
  - Provides consistent experience across languages
  - Allows for local validation before CI
- **Implications**:
  - Developers need pre-commit installed
  - May slightly increase setup complexity
  - Need to keep hooks updated across languages
