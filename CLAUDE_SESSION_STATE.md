# CLAUDE SESSION STATE

This document serves as a transition point between Claude Code sessions, capturing the current state of development and providing clear next steps for future sessions.

## Current Project: Eisenhower Matrix for todost

**Overall Status**: Planning phase complete, ready to begin implementation

## Planning Summary

We've completed the planning phase for adding Eisenhower Matrix functionality to the todost Python module:

1. **Analysis Complete**: 
   - Reviewed existing task prioritization in todost.py and para_rules.yaml
   - Designed integration approach for Eisenhower Matrix
   - Decided to use boolean fields for urgency/importance with a computed quadrant property

2. **Documentation Updated**:
   - Added to sprint plan (docs/planning/sprints/sprint_2025-05-06.md) as Story ENH-01
   - Updated dashboard (docs/planning/dashboard.md) with new feature
   - Created work summary (docs/reports/work_summary_2025-05-09.md)
   - Added architectural and technical decisions (docs/decisions/decisions.md)

3. **Implementation Plan Created**:
   - Created detailed plan in MCP softwareplanner with 7 implementation tasks
   - Tasks arranged by complexity (3-6) for efficient implementation

## Next Steps (Action Phase)

### Immediate Next Task
**Task 5.1.2**: Update GTDFields data model for Eisenhower Matrix (Complexity: 3)
- Add urgency and importance fields (booleans)
- Implement eisenhower_quadrant property (Q1-Q4)
- Update docstrings
- Ensure backward compatibility

### Following Tasks (in order)
1. **Task 5.1.3**: Implement rule-based classification (Complexity: 6)
2. **Task 5.1.4**: Add date-based urgency detection (Complexity: 4)
3. **Task 5.1.5**: Update JSON export format (Complexity: 3)
4. **Task 5.1.6**: Add unit tests (Complexity: 4)
5. **Task 5.1.7**: Update documentation (Complexity: 2)

## Source of Truth Structure

The project follows this documentation hierarchy:
- **Primary Source of Truth**: Sprint plans (docs/planning/sprints/sprint_*.md)
- **Status Overview**: Dashboard (docs/planning/dashboard.md)
- **Decision Records**: Decisions log (docs/decisions/decisions.md)
- **Daily Work Records**: Work summaries (docs/reports/work_summary_*.md)

## Implementation Strategy

Use the MCP softwareplanner to track progress through tasks:
```
mcp__softwareplanner__update_todo_status  # Mark tasks complete as you progress
```

Follow the four-phase development workflow from CLAUDE.md:
1. Initial Phase (COMPLETE)
2. Planning Phase (COMPLETE)
3. Action Phase (CURRENT) - Implementation of tasks 5.1.2 through 5.1.7
4. Finalization Phase - Final documentation, testing, and commit

## Pending Code Changes
- Uncommitted changes to todost.py to support container environment variables
- Uncommitted changes to MODULE.bazel and requirements_lock.txt

When returning to this project in a new session, please:
1. Read this document to understand current state
2. Check sprint plan for task details
3. Begin implementation of the next task in sequence
4. Update documentation as you progress
5. Mark completed tasks in softwareplanner
