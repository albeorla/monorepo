# PARA + GTD Rules for Todoist export
# This file defines how tasks and projects are categorized and enriched
#
# VERSION: 1.0.0
#
# This configuration drives the enrichment engine for Todoist exports.
# It contains three main sections:
# 1. regex_rules: Patterns to apply to task content and description
# 2. label_rules: Special handling for specific Todoist labels
# 3. bucket_overrides: Force specific projects into PARA buckets by ID

# Regex patterns to apply to task content and description
regex_rules:

  - pattern: "\b(?:high energy|deep work|deep focus)\b"
    field: "energy"
    value: "high"  # Tasks requiring deep focus or high energy
  
  - pattern: "\b(\d+)(?:\s+|-)(?:min|minute)s?\b"
    field: "time_needed"
    value: "$1"  # Captures "15 min" or "30-minutes" as number of minutes

# Force specific projects into certain PARA buckets by their Todoist ID
# (override the default logic in bucket_for_project)

  # Example: Force these projects to specific buckets regardless of due date or age
