# Architectural Decision Records

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Bazel Monorepo Platform project. These records document important architectural decisions made during project development, along with their context and consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made during project development, along with its context and consequences. ADRs help track the reasoning behind technical choices, ensuring that future developers understand why certain decisions were made.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR follows this format:

- **Title**: A descriptive name for the decision
- **Decision**: The decision that was made
- **Context**: The factors influencing the decision
- **Consequences**: The impacts of the decision (both positive and negative)

## Organization

The decisions are categorized as:

- **Architectural Decisions (AD)**: High-level structural choices
- **Technical Decisions (TD)**: Implementation-specific choices
- **Process Decisions (PD)**: Workflow and methodology choices

## Current Decisions

See [decisions.md](decisions.md) for the complete list of project decisions.

## Adding a New Decision

To document a new decision:

1. Update [decisions.md](decisions.md) with the new entry
2. Follow the established pattern for the decision type (AD/TD/PD)
3. Include all required sections (Decision, Context, Consequences)
4. Reference PRD requirements when applicable
