- **Task 5.1.3**: Created comprehensive cost efficiency guidelines

## Implementation Details

### CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

The following components were implemented:

1. **Python CI Workflow** (`python-ci.yml`):
   - Path-based triggers to only run on relevant changes
   - Separate jobs for linting, building/testing, and security scanning
   - Integration with cost tracking infrastructure

2. **Ruff Configuration** (`.ruff.toml`):
   - Comprehensive ruleset for Python code quality
   - Configuration aligned with project conventions
   - Documentation and test-specific rule adjustments

3. **Security Scanning** (`.github/trivy.yaml`):
   - Trivy configuration for vulnerability scanning
   - Severity thresholds for failing CI
   - Customized for Python project needs

### Cost Efficiency Infrastructure

Enhanced cost tracking with:

1. **Budget Check Action**:
   - Pre-workflow cost estimation
   - Budget enforcement with configurable thresholds
   - Detailed reporting of estimated costs

2. **Cost Reporting Action**:
   - Per-job cost calculation
   - Workflow summary generation
   - Warnings for budget overruns

3. **Cost Guidelines**:
   - Comprehensive documentation in CI_COST_GUIDELINES.md
   - Best practices for contributors and maintainers
   - Future improvement roadmap

## Next Steps

1. Test the CI workflow with actual pull requests
2. Add more granular metrics for specific Python modules
3. Integrate with a cost monitoring dashboard for trend analysis
