## Completed Tasks

### Container Registry Integration

#### âœ… Story: Registry Integration [PRD-F10-02]
- **Task 1.2.1**: Researched container registry options and selected GitHub Container Registry
- **Task 1.2.2**: Created registry configuration module for standardized publishing
- **Task 1.2.3**: Updated hello_python and todost modules for registry integration
- **Task 1.2.4**: Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated publishing
- **Task 1.2.5**: Added security scanning with Trivy
- **Task 1.2.6**: Created documentation for registry integration

## Implementation Details

### Container Registry Selection

1. **Registry Research and Selection**:
   - Evaluated GitHub Container Registry, Docker Hub, AWS ECR, and GCR
   - Selected GHCR for GitHub Actions integration, free tier, and security features
   - Created registry_recommendation.md documenting selection rationale

2. **Registry Configuration Module**:
   - Created `tools/oci/registry.bzl` with standardized repository formatting
   - Implemented tagging strategy based on git context
   - Set up GitHub organization-specific configurations
   - Added standard OCI labels

3. **Image Target Updates**:
   - Updated BUILD files for hello_python and todost
   - Added ghcr_push and ghcr_development_push targets
   - Configured image metadata and tags
   - Maintained backwards compatibility with existing targets

4. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Created container-publish.yml GitHub Actions workflow
   - Configured automatic build and push on main branch and tags
   - Set up conditional tagging based on git context
   - Added Trivy security scanning

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated container_workflow.md with registry information
   - Created container_registry_auth.md for authentication guidelines
   - Created container_cost_optimization.md for cost monitoring
   - Updated README.md with registry usage examples

## Technical Decisions

1. **GitHub Container Registry**: Selected for tight GitHub Actions integration, free tier for public repositories, and built-in security features.

2. **Repository Naming Convention**: Standardized on `ghcr.io/albeorla/{service_name}` format for consistent identification and organization.

3. **Tagging Strategy**:
   - `latest`: Most recent main branch build
   - Semantic versions (e.g., `1.0.0`): For tagged releases
   - PR numbers (e.g., `pr-123`): For pull request builds

4. **Security Scanning**: Integrated Trivy for vulnerability scanning with critical/high severity blocking.

5. **Cost Controls**: Implemented retention policies and optimization guidance.

## Next Steps

1. Configure multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64)
2. Implement cost monitoring dashboard
3. Add more sophisticated image promotion workflows
4. Create integration tests with containerized services
