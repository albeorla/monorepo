## In Progress

### Eisenhower Matrix Integration for todost

#### ‚è≥ Story: Eisenhower Matrix Integration [ENH-01]
- **Task 5.1.1**: Analyze current prioritization model and design integration
  - Completed initial analysis of existing prioritization system
  - Designed approach for Eisenhower Matrix integration
  - Documented key decisions in decisions.md (AD-004, TD-005)
  - Created detailed implementation plan with 7 tasks

- **Next Steps**:
  1. Update data model (Task 5.1.2)
  2. Implement rule-based classification (Task 5.1.3)
  3. Add date-based urgency detection (Task 5.1.4)
  4. Update JSON export (Task 5.1.5)

## Implementation Details

### Eisenhower Matrix Design Decisions

1. **Matrix Representation**:
   - Will use two boolean fields: `is_urgent` and `is_important` in the GTDFields model
   - A computed property will derive the quadrant (Q1-Q4) from these fields
   - Human-readable quadrant descriptions will be included in the output

2. **Integration with Current System**:
   - Leveraging existing rule-based system for classification
   - Will respect Todoist's native priority (p1-p4) for importance determination
   - Will use due dates to automatically calculate urgency

3. **Rule Extensions**:
   - Will extend para_rules.yaml with new patterns for urgency/importance
   - Will add label-based rules for explicit marking
   - Will include default thresholds for date-based urgency (configurable)

4. **Output Format**:
   - Will maintain backward compatibility
   - Will include new fields in task GTD metadata
   - May add optional statistics about quadrant distribution

## Technical Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1 - Model Updates**:
   - Add urgency/importance fields to GTDFields
   - Create computed eisenhower_quadrant property
   - Update model documentation

2. **Phase 2 - Detection Logic**:
   - Implement regex patterns for urgency/importance signals
   - Add date-based urgency detection
   - Integrate with priority system

3. **Phase 3 - Output and Testing**:
   - Update JSON serialization
   - Add comprehensive test cases
   - Update documentation

## Next Steps

1. Implement GTDFields model updates
2. Set up basic tests for the model
3. Implement rule-based classification
4. Verify with integration tests
