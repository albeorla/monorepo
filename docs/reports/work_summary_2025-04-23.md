# Work Summary: 2025-04-23

## Completed Tasks

### Epic: Python Infrastructure [PRD-F1, PRD-F5]

#### ✅ Story: Todoist Exporter Implementation [PRD-F1-01]
- **Task 1.1.3**: Fixed a minor regression in the test file (missing Path import) and verified all tests pass

#### ✅ Story: Python Module Scaffolding [PRD-F5-01]
- **Task 2.1.1**: Improved the Python scaffolding script with:
  - Support for optional description and author parameters
  - Better error handling and user feedback
  - Added proper file renaming for test files
  - Improved command-line interface with usage help

- **Task 2.1.2**: Created enhanced cookiecutter templates with:
  - Proper test templates with pytest fixtures
  - Type hints and docstrings
  - Example function implementation
  - Better BUILD.bazel configuration with test targets

- **Task 2.1.3**: Created comprehensive documentation for the scaffolding process:
  - Created PYTHON_SCAFFOLD_README.md with detailed instructions
  - Added usage examples and best practices
  - Documented template structure and customization options

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline (PRD-F8)
2. Add Ruff quality gates for Python (PRD-F13)
3. Implement cost efficiency metrics (PRD-F22)

## Implementation Details

### Python Scaffolding Improvements

The scaffolding system now supports:
- Creating modules with consistent structure
- Generating test files with proper pytest setup
- Configurable module parameters (name, description, author)
- Bazel build configuration with library, binary, and test targets
- Documentation generation
- Type hints and proper Python conventions

### Usage

```bash
./scaffolding/scaffold_python.sh <module_name> [description] [author]
```

For example:
```bash
./scaffolding/scaffold_python.sh data_processor "Processes data files" "Data Team"
```

This creates a new module at `python/data_processor/` with all necessary files.
