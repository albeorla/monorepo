# Work Summary: 2025-05-07

## Completed Tasks

### Container Infrastructure

#### ✅ Story: OCI Image Generation [PRD-F10-01]
- **Task 1.1.1**: Researched Bazel OCI image rules and dependencies
- **Task 1.1.2**: Set up distroless base images for Python services
- **Task 1.1.3**: Created container configuration for Python services
- **Task 1.1.4**: Documented container workflow and best practices

## Implementation Details

### Container Infrastructure Setup

1. **Created Custom Build Rules**:
   - Implemented `py_image` and `py_service_image` macros in `tools/rules/oci_python.bzl`
   - Configured OCI toolchain and extensions in MODULE.bazel
   - Created `tools/oci/base_images.bzl` to define distroless base images

2. **Base Image Selection**:
   - Selected Google's distroless Python 3.11 images (Debian 12-based)
   - Configured regular, nonroot, and debug variants
   - Pinned images to specific digests for reproducibility
   - Supported multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64)

3. **OCI Image Configuration**:
   - Added container build targets to hello_python module (proof of concept)
   - Added container build targets to todost module (with dependencies)
   - Configured proper environment variables and labels
   - Set up OCI push targets for local Docker testing

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/container_workflow.md`
   - Updated README.md with container build instructions
   - Documented security considerations and best practices
   - Provided troubleshooting guidance and examples

## Technical Decisions

1. **Distroless Images**: Selected Google's distroless Python images for minimum attack surface and size. Using nonroot variants by default for better security posture.

2. **Layering Strategy**: Configured proper layering with base image → dependencies → application code for optimal caching and rebuilds.

3. **Macro Approach**: Created reusable macros for standardized container builds across the codebase, reducing duplication and enforcing best practices.

4. **Local Development**: Set up Docker-compatible image building for local testing before registry integration is completed.

## Next Steps

1. Complete Registry Integration:
   - Configure container registry authentication
   - Set up automatic image tagging with CI
   - Add cost monitoring for container storage

2. Implement Cross-Service Examples:
   - Create a docker-compose configuration for local development
   - Set up integration tests with containers

3. CI Integration:
   - Update GitHub Actions workflow for OCI image building
   - Configure security scanning for container images
